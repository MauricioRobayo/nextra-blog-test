Around 2008 I discovered programming while working with Microsoft Excel. I wrote my first lines of code using VBA, and that was it. I was hooked. Writing VBA scripts to doâ€¦ whatever, became my time-consuming hobby.

I bought books, watched videos, jumped into Microsoft Access and was fascinated by databases, and was struggling to keep up with my regular life because all the time I wanted to explore more to see what else was possible.

By 2012 I created a blog about Excel, and I began to tinker around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I bought more books, watched more videos, and got an angry wife competing for my time in the evenings and during weekends.

Then I learned WordPress and PHP and built websites for everyone around me as a side gig. I wrote custom templates and silly plugins. Built some toy projects using CodeIgniter, just for fun, did online CS courses, learned Python, and played around with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

But it was not enough. Evenings and weekends were not enough.

I love figuring things out. I love ploughing into complex mechanisms to unveil their underlying structure, simplify it, and push it further. And wanted to do it full-time.

In 2019 I was able to take a year off to fully commit to learning in-depth web development and focused on mastering JavaScript. I plunged deep into TypeScript, React, and Nodejs, and have skyrocketed as a professional web developer ever since.
